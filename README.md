The project highlights an effective and efficient solution to the limitations provided by the conventional parking
system. The entire smart parking model (SPM) comprises of a
prototype based on two-lane entrance and exit infrastructure.
The software environment is used for data processing, storage
and decision making, booking application and SMS service using
Fast2SMS API for notifying users. The prototype is integrated
with RFID scanners, servo motors, infrared sensors, ultrasonic
sensors and LDR sensors connected with arduino. The arduino
sends and receives data via serial communication with the
software environment based on python which behaves as the
central processing unit of the model. The data received by the
software environment is pre-processed and sent to the IBM IoT
device in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format from where
it is fetched by Node-RED for filtration, storage and then finally
to display on the web dashboard. The booking application allows
the user to check the status of the parking slot, and based on
the availability, book a slot by providing valid credentials of the
vehicle,thereby enhancing another dimension of the model.
